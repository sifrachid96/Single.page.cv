Single-Page CV Project
🎯 Single Page CV Projects
Welcome to Single.page.cv, a growing collection of creative and professional single-page CV (curriculum vitae) templates built using HTML, CSS, and occasionally JavaScript. These CV designs are crafted by me, Rachid Sifeddine, to showcase modern, responsive, and unique layouts that you can use or customize for your own needs.

🚀 About the Project

Each CV is:

Fully built with HTML/CSS

Simple to customize and edit

Responsive (mobile-friendly where possible)

Aimed to balance creativity and professionalism
