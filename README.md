Single-Page CV Project
🎯 Single Page CV Projects
Welcome to Single.page.cv, a growing collection of creative and professional single-page CV (curriculum vitae) templates built using HTML, CSS, and occasionally JavaScript. These CV designs are crafted by me, Rachid Sifeddine, to showcase modern, responsive, and unique layouts that you can use or customize for your own needs.

🚀 About the Project
This repository includes various single-page CV templates, each with a unique design and structure. The goal is to provide a helpful resource for developers, designers, and job seekers looking to create a visually appealing CV that stands out.

Each CV is:

Fully built with HTML/CSS

Simple to customize and edit

Responsive (mobile-friendly where possible)

Aimed to balance creativity and professionalism

🛠️ New designs will be added over time, so check back regularly or star this repo to stay updated!

🎯 Working on the "Single Page CV" project from roadmap.sh!

I'm currently building a collection of single-page CV templates using just HTML and CSS — clean, responsive, and ready to customize. This project is helping me sharpen my front-end skills and build something practical for real-world use.
